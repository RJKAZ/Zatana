Watch as the Mistress of Magic uses Javascript to cast spells


I need to start this one from scratch, but the key to doing it will be the javscript class change functions


So, I'm gonna start this one fronm stratch

but I'm gonna limit it firest. I need to start off small and with each click get the text color to change. That would be easier then doing the whole effects. Once I can get the color change working, I should be able to get the effects working.
