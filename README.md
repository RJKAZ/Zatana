Watch as the Mistress of Magic uses Javascript to cast spells


I need to start this one from scratch, but the key to doing it will be the javscript class change functions


So, I'm gonna start this one fronm stratch

but I'm gonna limit it firest. I need to start off small and with each click get the text color to change. That would be easier then doing the whole effects. Once I can get the color change working, I should be able to get the effects working. 

Another failure -

I set up an event listener to listen to the clicks from two buttons. Console log works, but only one color or the other works. I had this problem with other attempts. Back to the drawing board.

lol...and I got it....the whole class name nightmare is figured out. Now to jazz the CSS a whole hell of a lot more.
